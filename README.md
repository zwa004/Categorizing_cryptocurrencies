# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
The overview of this project was to classify groups of cryptocurrencies for investor portfolios.

## Overview
Cryptocurrency data was cleaned and scaled using pandas. Principle Componenet Analysis was then performed leaving 3 components affecting clustering. Using an elbow curve, 4 clusters were best for Kmeans clustering. The Kmeans algorithm clearly separated (see 3d plot) the cryptocurrencies into 4 distinct classes based on supply, mined, algorithm, and prooftype.
